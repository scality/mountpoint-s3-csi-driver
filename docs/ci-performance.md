# CI Performance Benchmarks

## Overview

This document analyzes the expected performance improvements from the CI workflow optimization implemented in ticket S3CSI-10.

## Performance Comparison

### Original Workflow

The original workflow (`unit-tests.yaml`) ran all tests sequentially:

1. Check style: ~15 seconds
2. Install go-test-coverage: ~5 seconds
3. Build: ~1 minute
4. Test (unit tests + sanity tests with race detection): ~7 minutes
5. Check test coverage: ~30 seconds
6. Upload coverage: ~20 seconds

**Total estimated time**: ~9 minutes

### Optimized Workflow

The new workflow (`tests.yaml`) runs jobs in parallel:

1. **Style check job**: ~15 seconds
   - Check out repository
   - Set up Go with caching
   - Run style check

2. **Unit tests job**: ~3.5 minutes
   - Check out repository
   - Set up Go with caching
   - Run unit tests with increased parallelism (-parallel 8)
   - Upload coverage directly to Codecov

3. **Sanity tests job**: ~45 seconds
   - Check out repository
   - Set up Go with caching
   - Run sanity tests

**Total estimated time**: ~4 minutes (limited by the longest job, unit tests)

## Performance Improvements

1. **Parallel Execution**: Running jobs in parallel reduces total execution time by ~55%
2. **Increased Test Parallelism**: Using `-parallel 8` for unit tests speeds up test execution
3. **Go Module Caching**: Faster builds after the first run due to cached dependencies
4. **Simplified Coverage Reporting**: Direct integration with Codecov eliminates extra steps
5. **Eliminated Build Step**: No longer building binaries before running tests

## Theoretical Benefits

The new workflow should achieve the following benefits:

1. **Reduced CI Time**: From ~9 minutes to ~4 minutes
2. **Faster Feedback**: Developers get feedback on style issues and sanity tests sooner
3. **More Efficient Resource Usage**: Jobs run concurrently, utilizing GitHub Actions resources better
4. **Improved Maintainability**: Simplified workflow with separate, focused jobs

## Next Steps

After the new workflow is deployed:

1. Monitor actual execution times over several runs
2. Fine-tune parallelism settings if needed
3. Consider further splitting unit tests if they remain the bottleneck
