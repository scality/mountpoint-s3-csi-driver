# File Operations Test Plan for S3 CSI Driver

This document outlines the test plan for validating basic file operations with the S3 CSI Driver.

## Test Objectives

To verify that the S3 CSI Driver correctly supports all essential file operations when mounting S3 buckets as volumes in Kubernetes pods.

## Test Categories

### 1. Basic File Operations

- **File Creation**
  - Create files of various sizes (empty, small, medium, large)
  - Create files with special characters in names
  - Create files with very long names

- **File Reading**
  - Read entire files of different sizes
  - Perform partial reads (specific byte ranges)
  - Verify content integrity

- **File Updates**
  - Overwrite existing files
  - Append data to existing files
  - Modify specific portions of files

- **File Deletion**
  - Delete individual files
  - Delete multiple files in sequence
  - Attempt to delete non-existent files

### 2. Directory Operations

- **Directory Creation**
  - Create empty directories
  - Create nested directory structures
  - Create directories with special characters

- **Directory Listing**
  - List empty directories
  - List directories with few files
  - List directories with many files
  - List directory hierarchies

- **Directory Deletion**
  - Delete empty directories
  - Delete directories with content
  - Delete nested directory structures

### 3. Metadata and Permissions

- **File Metadata**
  - Check file sizes
  - Check file timestamps
  - Test extended attributes (if supported)

- **File Permissions**
  - Test read/write permissions
  - Test execution permissions (if applicable)
  - Test ownership settings

### 4. Concurrent Operations

- **Multiple Readers**
  - Test multiple pods reading the same file
  - Verify data consistency across readers

- **Multiple Writers**
  - Test multiple pods writing to different files in same volume
  - Test contention handling for same-file writes (if supported)

### 5. Edge Cases

- **Path Handling**
  - Test absolute vs relative paths
  - Test path traversal (../file)
  - Test maximum path length

- **Special Files**
  - Test zero-byte files
  - Test very large files (multi-GB if supported)
  - Test file names with various character sets

## Test Implementation Plan

1. Create a new test suite in the `testsuites/` directory
2. Implement test cases for each category
3. Ensure proper cleanup after each test
4. Add metrics collection for performance-sensitive operations
5. Integrate with existing test framework

## Success Criteria

- All basic file operations work correctly
- File content integrity is maintained
- Directory operations function as expected
- Proper error handling for invalid operations
- Performance meets acceptable thresholds

## Test Environment Requirements

- Kubernetes cluster with S3 CSI driver installed
- Access to S3 endpoint
- Sufficient permissions for all operations
- Multiple worker nodes for concurrent testing
